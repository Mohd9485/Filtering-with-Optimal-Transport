# Nonlinear Filtering with Brenier Optimal Transport Maps
We have six experiments. Except for the "Static example," all of them contain a "main.py" to generate the necessary data and an "import_DATA.py" file to visualize the results. In the "Static example" folder, there's a single file that can be executed to both produce and plot the results. The same instructions have been provided in each folder.

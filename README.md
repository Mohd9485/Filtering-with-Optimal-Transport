# Nonlinear Filtering with Brenier Optimal Transport Maps
We have six experiments. Except for the "Static example," all of them contain a "main.py" to generate the necessary data and an "import_DATA.py" file to visualize the results. In the "Static example" folder, there's a single file that can be executed to both produce and plot the results. The same instructions have been provided in each folder.


This repository is by Mohammad Al-Jarrah, Niyizhen Jin, [Bamdad Hosseini](https://bamdadhosseini.org/), [Amirhossein Taghvaei](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/amir-taghvaei) and contains the Pytorch source code to reproduce the experiments in our 2024 paper [Nonlinear Filtering with Brenier Optimal Transport Maps](https://openreview.net/forum?id=blzDxD6bKt). 


Please consider reading the paper for further details on this example. Also, please consider citing our paper if you find this repository useful for your publication.

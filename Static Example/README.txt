In "static_example.py" file lines 170 and 171, change the value of "experiment" variable to "squared" to get the bimodal static example and to "linear" to get the Unimodal example.
Also when "squared" is chosen, you can set "sigma_w = 0.04" in line 173 for smaller noise ratio. The "1D_convexity_check.py" file is to repoduce the convexity figures in the paper.
